      <description>What do I need to do to get my drum engraved? The first step to getting your drum engraved is to decide your budget. Most classic patterns fall in the $250-$550 range with the most popular vintage patterns in the $350-$450 range. Since all prices are based on the time it takes to produce your engraving (including the artwork for the patterns), you can save money by choosing a pattern that I&amp;rsquo;ve already produced, as the patterns are already made.</description>
